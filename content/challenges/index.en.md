## SF-PICar-V Computer Vision with SimpleCV
#### Skill level required:
Intermediate/Advanced

#### Hardware:
* SF-PiCar-V
* Sensors of choice

#### Task:
Warm up with the implementation of the car and camera movement.
Create a WebApp to connect, control and live stream the camera footage.
To spice the whole project up you can expand the robot with sensors and implement
new features on your robot. In addition it is a good chance to get your
hands on Computer Vision using for example the [SimpleCV](http://www.simplecv.org) library.

## Raspberry PEye
#### Skill level required:
Intermediate/Advanced

#### Hardware:
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* Raspberry Pi Camera
* Camera Pan/Tilt-Halter

#### Task:
Use this setup to dive into Computer Vision. With the [SimpleCV](http://www.simplecv.org) library and
this hardware set-up you have a good setup to experiment and implement from basic
to advanced features using Computer Vision.

## PICar-S
#### Skill level required:
Beginner/Intermediate

#### Hardware:
* PiCar-S
* Sensors of choice

#### Task:
This Task is structured in 3 main tasks which will be documented and guided:
* Controlls for your bot (forward, backward, left, right)
* Collision avoidance using the US Sensor
* Line tracking using 4 IR Sensors

Having implemented those essential libraries for your bot you are free to implement
additional features using either software or hardware to make your car smart.


## Arduino Bot
#### Skill level required:
Beginner/Intermediate

#### Hardware:
* SF-PiCar-V
* Sensors of choice


#### Task:
This Task is structured in 3 main tasks which will be documented and guided:
* Controlls for your bot (forward, backward, left, right)
* Collision avoidance using the US Sensor
* Line tracking using 5 IR Sensors

After implementing those libraries your free to tune the robot as you like.


## Raspberry Pi Morse-to-Email-Gateway
#### Skill level required:
Beginner/Intermediate

#### Hardware:
* Provided by AdNovum
* Sensors of choice

#### Task:
The Raspberry Pi will be set up with push buttons and LEDs. This setup will be used
to send Morse code via email. A button will be recording the message, another will
play back the recorded message and a third button will send the message via email.

## ArduiPi-Sandbox
#### Skill level required:
Beginer/Intermediate/Advanced

#### Hardware:
* SF-PiCar-V
* Sensors of choice

#### Task:
Raspberry Pis, Arduinos and many sensors of different kind are provided to be combined
into any project you like. Build and develop something you've seen on the internet like
for example projects from [PiMyLifeUp](https://www.pimylifeup.com) or something you've
had in mind. These project can be presented at the ent of the event if desired.
