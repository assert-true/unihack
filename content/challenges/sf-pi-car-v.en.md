title: "SF-PICar-V Computer Vision with SimpleCV"
levels:
    - Intermediate
    - Advanced
hardware:
    - SF-PiCar-V
    - Sensors of your choice

Warm up with the implementation of the car and camera movement.
Create a WebApp to connect, control and live stream the camera footage.
To spice the whole project up you can expand the robot with sensors and implement
new features on your robot. In addition it is a good chance to get your
hands on Computer Vision using for example [SimpleCV](http://www.simplecv.org).
