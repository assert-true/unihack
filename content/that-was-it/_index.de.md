title: This was Unihack 2019
---

Thank you for being part of the unihack 2019! We had a blast and really enjoyed working with all
the creative, passionate and skilled teams. We definitely hope to see everyone again at the
next Unihack.


The success of the unihack is **thanks in large part to our sponsors** who supported us with delicious
chocolate bytes, boosting drinks which gave us wings and inspiring speeches. A special thanks
goes out to the **University of Bern**, particularly the informatics department and domestic services
who had a determining influence on the success of this event.


Below you find the best snap shots of the event, as well as other resources. Be sure to check
